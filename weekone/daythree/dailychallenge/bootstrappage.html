				<h2>Really Informative Info</h2>
				<p>I don't know what it is about me that I love to list things. After the massive list of 66 exotic fruits from around the world, I had to take on the next thing and list as many weird/cool vegetables I could find. Many of these I've actually seen and tried in my travels through Southeast Asia, but some of these goodies from Africa or South American I had never heard of until now.

				Oh, and one more thing. Before I get too many angry emails in my inbox, I know that a few of the foods on this list of 36 weird vegetables are not actually vegetables. Anything with a seed is technically a fruit. But whatever man, close enough.

				According to Wikipedia, “In everyday usage, a vegetable is any part of a plant that is consumed by humans as food as part of a savoury course or meal.”

				So there are some things which are considered vegetables in the culinary vocabulary, but are not vegetables in the botanical sense. And if you like weird stuff, you'll really like these 30 fruits & veggies with unique colors like black garlic, purple broccoli, and red bananas!.</p>
